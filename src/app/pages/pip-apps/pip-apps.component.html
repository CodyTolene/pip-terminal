    <h2>Apps</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the <strong>Community Apps Terminal</strong>. This page
      displays all available applications and games made by other Vault Dwellers
      that can be launched directly from your
      <strong>Pip-Boy 3000 Mk V</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once installed, you'll find these apps under the
      <strong>INV &gt; APPS</strong> menu on your device. Many apps are designed
      to feel right at home in the Wasteland â€” utilities, minigames,
      diagnostics, and more.

    <p>
      New apps are added regularly by the community. Want to make your own?
      Check out the open-source project on
      <a

      >
      and explore sample apps, documentation, and tooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      All apps are safely sandboxed and can be removed at any time. Don't be
      afraid to experiment, the Pip-Boy is more capable than it looks.

    <p>
      To get started, use the controls below to browse, install, or launch apps.
      If something seems off, try restarting the device, and last resort, you
      can reset the device to factory settings on
