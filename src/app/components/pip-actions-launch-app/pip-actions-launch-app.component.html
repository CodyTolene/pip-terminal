        Pip-Snake is a simple game where you control a snake that moves around
        the screen. The snake grows longer as it eats food, and the game is over
        when the snake runs into itself. The goal is to eat as much food as
        possible before the game ends.

        Use the radio tune-up button to turn clockwise, and the radio tune-down
        button to turn counter-clockwise. Press the front radio on/off button to
        restart the game, and press the top torch button to stop/exit the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tip: you can hit the edges of the screen and the snake will wrap around
        to the other side.
